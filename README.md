[DEMO LINK](https://effulgent-bunny-bbabbb.netlify.app/)

## Description

Today I challenged myself to complete a front end React app in one day.

It took me 10 hours from inception to deployment.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript ES6+
- JSX
- React (Components, Hooks(State and Refs), Fragments)
- Bootstrap 5 (the new 5.2 beta)
- Heroku
- Git and Github

I used the [Spoontacular API](https://spoonacular.com/) which provide 150 free API calls per day.

## Features

Input what you have in your fridge/pantry/cold cellar, and it will return a dozen recipes that use those items, and indicate additional ingredients you need. Then click thru for the detailed recipe.

## Lessons Learned During Development

- Working under a time crunch - it's better make things work now, then make the pretty later
- Simple is better -> this project has very few dependancies
- It's amazing what you can accomplish when you focus
